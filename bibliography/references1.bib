   abstract = {Designing lab exercises for introductory biology classes requires balancing the need for students to obtain results with a desire to provide unpredictable outcomes to better approximate actual research. Bacteriophage are particularly well suited for this as many species are well-understood but, with their hosts, represent a relatively complex interacting system. I have designed a seven week series of lab exercises that allow students to select bacteriophage resistant mutant hosts, isolate and sequence the corresponding receptor gene to identify the specific bacterial mutation from a large number of potential mutations. I also examined the possibility of collecting useful mutant strains for other studies. After two semesters, the lab series is working well with over 90% of students successfully isolating mutant bacteria and about half identifying the specific mutation. Here I discuss the advantages of using bacteriophage in an introductory class, the specific labs in this series and future plans.},

   abstract = {Python has become a popular language for the delivery of introductory programming courses. Two reasons for this are Python's convenience and syntactic simplicity, giving a low entry barrier for beginners and the ability to solve complex problems with short snippets of code. However, students exhibit widespread misconceptions about the meaning of basic language constructs, inhibiting their ability to solve problems and damaging their understanding of fundamental concepts. In this paper, we document our observations of level 1 university students over several years, as well as surveys probing the nature of their misconceptions. We analyze the misconceptions in relation to a notional machine model for Python, and show that many students form inadequate and brittle mental models of the language. Our results indicate that one of the major sources of misunderstanding is the heavy use of overloading in Python. Overloading hides the complexity of algorithms and data structures, often leading students to write code that involves mutability, sharing, copying, side effects, coroutines, concurrency, and lazy evaluation-and none of those topics are accessible to students who haven't yet mastered basic assignments, conditionals, and looping. We suggest that Python, when taught alone, is insufficient as an introductory language: students can gain a firmer grasp of programming fundamentals when Python is presented alongside a complementary low level language that makes a notional machine clear and explicit.},

This definition highlights that CT is primarily a way of thinking and acting, which can be exhibited through the use particular skills, which then can become the basis for performance-based assessments of CT skills. Based on the literature, we categorized CT into six main facets: decomposition, abstraction, algorithm design, debugging, iteration, and generalization. This paper shows examples of CT definitions, interventions, assessments, and models across a variety of disciplines, with a call for more extensive research in this area.},

A sample of 126 respondents comprises students of the last year of all study programs. The results show that students and professors have a positive attitude about using computers in education and knowledge dissemination through computers. Most of them think that teachers have mastered basic computer knowledge, but give priority to teachers who know how to work with a computer, as well as to younger teachers. Students believe that many barriers occur during the use of computers, among which the most important is the inaccessibility of technical equipment.

   abstract = {There is an increasing role of population genetics in human genetic research linking empirical observations with hypotheses about sequence variation due to historical and evolutionary causes. In addition, the data sets are increasing in size, with genome-wide data becoming a common place in many empirical studies. As far as more information is available, it becomes clear that simplest hypotheses are not consistent with data. Simulations will provide the key tool to contrast complex hypotheses on real data by generating simulated data under the hypothetical historical and evolutionary conditions that we want to contrast. Undoubtedly, developing tools for simulating large sequences that at the same time allow simulate natural selection, recombination and complex demography patterns will be of great interest in order to better understanding the trace left on the DNA by different interacting evolutionary forces. Simulation tools will be also essential to evaluate the sampling properties of any statistics used on genome-wide association studies and to compare performance of methods applied at genome-wide scales. Several recent simulation tools have been developed. Here, we review some of the currently existing simulators which allow for efficient simulation of large sequences on complex evolutionary scenarios. In addition, we will point out future directions in this field which are already a key part of the current research in evolutionary biology and it seems that it will be a primary tool in the future research of genome and post-genomic biology.},

Authoritarian people especially think youth are less respectful of their elders, intelligent people especially think youth are less intelligent, and well-read people especially think youth enjoy reading less. These beliefs are not predicted by irrelevant traits. Two mechanisms contribute to humanity's perennial tendency to denigrate kids: a person-specific tendency to notice the limitations of others where one excels and a memory bias projecting one's current qualities onto the youth of the past. When observing current children, we compare our biased memory to the present and a decline appears. This may explain why the kids these days effect has been happening for millennia.},

The allelic states of all homologous gene copies in a population are determined by the genealogical and mutational history of these copies. The coalescent approach is based on the realization that the genealogy is usually easier to model backward in time, and that selectively neutral mutations can then be superimposed afterwards. A wide range of biological phenomena can be modeled using this approach. Whereas almost all of classical population genetics considers the future of a population given a starting point, the coalescent considers the present, while taking the past into account. This allows the calculation of probabilities of sample configurations under the stationary distribution of various population genetic models, and makes full likelihood analysis of polymorphism data possible. It also leads to extremely efficient computer algorithms for generating simulated data from such distributions, data which can then be compared with observations as a form of exploratory data analysis.},

@article{Servedio2014,
   abstract = {Recent advances in many fields of biology have been driven by a synergistic approach involving observation, experiment , and mathematical modeling (see, e.g., [1]). Evolutionary biology has long required this approach, due in part to the complexity of population-level processes and to the long time scales over which evolutionary processes occur. Indeed, the ''modern evolutionary synthesis'' of the 1930s and 40s-a pivotal moment of intellectual convergence that first reconciled Mendelian genetics and gene frequency change with natural selection-hinged on elegant mathematical work by RA Fisher, Sewall Wright, and JBS Haldane. Formal (i.e., mathematical) evolutionary theory has continued to mature; models can now describe how evolutionary change is shaped by genome-scale properties such as linkage and epistasis [2,3], complex demographic variability [4], environmental variability [5], and individual and social behavior [6,7] within and between species. Despite their integral role in evolutionary biology, the purpose of certain types of mathematical models is often questioned [8]. Some view models as useful only insofar as they generate immediately testable quantitative predictions [9], and others see them as tools to elaborate empirically-derived biological patterns but not to independently make substantial new advances [10]. Doubts about the utility of mathematical models are not limited to present day studies of evolution indeed , this is a topic of discussion in many fields including ecology [11,12], physics [13], and economics [14], and has been debated in evolution previously [15]. We believe that skepticism about the value of mathematical models in the field of evolution stems from a common misunderstanding regarding the goals of particular types of models. While the connection between empiricism and some forms of theory (e.g., the construction of likelihood functions for parameter inference and model choice) is straightforward, the importance of highly abstract models-which might not make immediately test-able predictions-can be less evident to empiricists. The lack of a shared understanding of the purpose of these ''proof-of-concept'' models represents a roadblock for progress and hinders dialogue between scientists studying the same topics but using disparate approaches. This conceptual gap obstructs the stated goals of evolutionary biologists; a recent survey of evolutionary biologists and ecologists reveals that the community wants more interaction between theoretical and empirical research than is currently perceived to occur [16]. To promote this interaction, we clarify the role of mathematical models in evolutionary biology. First, we briefly describe how models fall along a continuum from those designed for quantitative prediction to abstract models of biological processes. Then, we highlight the unique utility of proof-of-concept models, at the far end of this continuum of abstraction, presenting several examples. We stress that the development of rigorous analytical theory with proof-of-concept models is itself a test of verbal hypotheses [11,17], and can in fact be as strong a test as an elegant experiment. Degrees of Abstraction in Evolutionary Theory Good evolutionary theory always derives its motivation from the natural world Essays articulate a specific perspective on a topic of broad interest to scientists.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a simulation-based optimization method for the design of antenna patterns in mobile broadcasting, multi-bandwidth operation and the 802.11a WLAN is presented. The simulation-based genetic algorithm (GA) is advanced for the antenna design automation with requested specifications. The corresponding cost function in optimization is evaluated by an external numerical electromagnetic (EM) solver, where the communication between the GA and EM solver is implemented with our unified optimization framework (UOF). An A Z-shaped antenna is explored as an example to express the optimization methodology with respect to the specific return loss. Inspired by the scenario of GA for the optical proximity correction in our earlier work, we firstly partition the edges of the antenna into small segments, and then adjust the movements of each segment to construct a newer geometry for the designed antenna with a better return loss. The external EM solver is then performed to calculate the return loss of the newer antenna. The optimized antenna pattern is achieved when the simulated results meet the specific constraints, and then UOF exports the antenna pattern with the better return loss evaluated by the external EM solver. Otherwise, the evolutionary algorithm will enable us to search for a better solution again. UOF presents the capability in the optimization with an external solver. Our preliminary numerical results confirm the robustness and efficiency of the developed simulation-based optimization method. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes - although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

   abstract = {The worked example effect indicates that examples providing full guidance on how to solve a problem result in better test performance than a problem-solving condition with no guidance. The generation effect occurs when learners generating responses demonstrate better test performance than learners in a presentation condition that provides an answer. This contradiction may be resolved by the suggestion that the worked example effect occurs for complex, high-element interactivity materials that impose a heavy working memory load whereas the generation effect is applicable for low-element interactivity materials. Two experiments tested this hypothesis in the area of geometry instruction using students with different levels of prior knowledge in geometry. The results of Experiment 1 indicated a worked example effect obtained for materials high in element interactivity and a generation effect for materials low in element interactivity. As levels of expertise increased in Experiment 2, thus reducing effective complexity, this interaction was replaced by a generation effect for all materials. These results suggest that when students need to learn low-element interactivity material, learning will be enhanced if they generate rather than study responses but if students need to learn high-element interactivity material, study may be preferable to generating responses.},

   abstract = {Using scripting languages such as R to perform population genetic analyses can improve the reproducibility of research, but using R can be challenging for many researchers due to its steep learning curve. PopGenReport is a new R package that simplifies performing population genetics analyses in R, through the use of a new report-generating function. The function popgenreport allows users to perform up to 13 pre-defined and 1 user-defined analyses through the use of a single command line. Each analysis generates figures and tables that are incorporated into a pdf report and are also made available as individual files (figures are provided in multiple formats, table contents are provided as csv files). The package includes new R functions that simplify the importation of data from a spreadsheet file, examine allele distributions across populations and loci and identify private alleles, determine pairwise individual genetic distances using the methods of Smouse and Peakall and Kosman and Leonard, respectively, detect the presence of null alleles, calculate allelic richness, and test for spatial autocorrelation in genotypes using the methods of Smouse and Peakall. The package has a modular structure that makes the process of adding new functionality straightforward. To facilitate the addition of user-designed functions, the package includes a fully customizable module that can be automatically included in the pdf report. To support users not experienced in R, the website (www.popgenreport.org) has a tutorial for the package and a downloadable, portable version of the package with LaTeX pre-configured for the Windows operating system. © 2014 The Authors.
